Notes
-----

Setup, backups and restores are done with mysql utilities that should be
available on the web server.  For convenience, these are run in a
somewhat insecure way, which could allow someone with sufficient access
to the web server to see your mysql user name and login.  It's not a bad
problem, but keep that in mind when you decide how often to back up.

See the Housekeeping tab for some notes and suggestions.
