    <h1><a name="tour">Introductory Tour</a></h1>

    <p>So you have your own installation of the service planner, and now
you'd like to know how to use it.  This introduction should help.  I'll
try to keep it brief, at the risk of leaving out some important or
advanced things.</p>

    <p>It will help to have a web browser window open to the service
planner beside this introduction, so you can try things yourself as your
read.</p>

    <p>The pages of the service planner are arranged in a series of tabs
accessible across the top of the window.  Anyone can use the service
planner, but unless you log in, you will only see a limited number of tabs.
Login links and related information are at the very top of the page on the
left side.  Privileged users will also see a "User Administration" link at
the center of the very top when they are logged in.  That's where you
manage other users, if you need any.</p>

    <p>On the right of the very top is an Adjust Styles link, which opens a
dialog box on the screen allowing you to make some adjustments to the
layout of the service listing.  Unless you are dissatisfied with the
listing at some point, just ignore that link.</p>

    <p>There are three tabs available to anonymous (not logged-in) users:
"Upcoming Hymns," "Service Records," and "Cross Ref."  The first simply
lists all hymns in their services from this day forward, in chronological
order.  The very next service is at the top of the list.  "Service Records"
is similar, but it shows <em>all</em> services that have been planned, with
the latest (farthest in the future) at the top of the list.  The Cross Ref
tab displays a cross-reference table of hymn numbers from various books.
Clicking on a blue heading causes the page to reload, sorted on that
column.</p>

    <p>On the Service Records page (and the soon-to-be-introduced Modify
Services page), for your convenience, there is a <a name="thisweek">Jump to
This Week</a> link-button at the top right of the page, which will scroll the
page to contemporary planned services.  (That's different from planned
contemporary services, which the service planner does not support.)</p>

    <p>Under the main heading is an adjustable Listing Limit, which allows
you to specify how many hymns should be listed on the page.  When you get a
lot of hymns in the service planner, and you load all of them, the page
refresh can get a mite slow.</p>

    <p>When you log in, the Service Records page is replaced with the much more
powerful Modify Services page.  This is where you add new services or change
ones you've already planned.  Two more buttons behind the Listing Limit allow
you to list only future hymns (like the Upcoming Hymns page) or show all hymns
(like the Service Records page).</p>

    <p>Each service is listed under its own heading line containing the date
and location of the service and liturgical day name.  Below that line appear
the <em>Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary (ELH)</em>'s topical description for
hymns on that day, as well as the liturgical color for paraments.</p>
